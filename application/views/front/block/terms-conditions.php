        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to our policies, and these Conditions of Sale at any time. You will be subject to the policies and Conditions of Sale in force at the time you order goods from us, unless any change to those policies or these conditions is required to be made by law or government authority (in which case it will apply to orders previously placed by you). If any of these conditions is deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that condition will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.</p>        

<h3 class="text-4">11. Events beyond our reasonable control</h3>
        <p>We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.</p>                

<h3 class="text-4">12. Waiver</h3>
        <p>If you breach these conditions and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these conditions.</p>

<h3 class="text-4">13. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
        <p>These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, and the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree, as we do, to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts at Delhi.</p>
